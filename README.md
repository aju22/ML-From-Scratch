# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using only native Python and NumPy.

## Introduction

In this repository, I've implemented several popular machine learning algorithms using Python and NumPy, without relying on external libraries. The goal is to provide a clear and educational resource for understanding the internals of these algorithms.

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file and is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to aid comprehension. This repository is a great resource for learning how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Algorithms

The implemented algorithms include:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Feed Forward Neural Network (MLP)
- ... (Much more will be added)

## Getting Started

To use these implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git```

2. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory you're interested in:
   ```cd algorithm-name```
   
4. Open the algorithm's Python file in your preferred editor to study the code and comments.

## Usage

Each algorithm's implementation comes with a clear and concise example that demonstrates how to use it on a sample dataset. The examples are contained within the respective algorithm's Python file.

To run the example for a specific algorithm, simply execute its Python file using your Python interpreter.
